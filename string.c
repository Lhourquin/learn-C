	if char can store number between -128 and 127, we rarely use char for this in C.
	char allows to stored number from -128 to 127, with unsigned char we can store number from 0 to 255
	Usualy, even if the number is little, we stored it on type int.certainly that take more memory, but nowaday,it's realy not that missing on a computer.
	
	the type char is planned to store only one char, be aware, only one char. The memory can store only numberso we inventde a table that made convertion between number and letter,
	Thus, the table indicate the number 65 equal the letter A.
	The C language allows to make esealy the translation letter to the appropriate number
	To get the number associated to the letter, we have to write this letter between ' ' like this 'A' 
	At the compilation, the 'A' will be replaced by the coresspondant value.
