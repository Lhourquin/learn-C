HEAP : The term "heap" refers to memory that C manages on our behalf when we need to "borrow" a bit of memory and give it back later. There a are a lot of couple of issues with a simple heap implementation. First, if we "forget" to call free(), when we are done with the memory, we have created "memory leak" and our program eventually will run out of memory and abort. C places the responsability of giving back any dynamically allocated memory on the programmer. Modern language like Java, JavaScript, Python keep track of when we stop using a dynamic memory layer that can autmaticaly reclaim the memory. this.

Arithmetic opertations: + - * / %
Comparion Operators: == != <> <= 
Variable naming rules - letter/underscore + numbers/letters/underscores - also break and continue loops
Constant similar except for strings and characters and booleans
Both have int / float, and char /byte
	- C has no str, or dict
	- Python has noo strcut or double

Difference between Python and C:
Boolean operators
	- and / not  / or versus && ! ||
C for loops are inderterminant (i.E no for ... in in C)
C has no pre defined True or False
None and NULL are similar concepts but quite different(0 in C ?)
Strings and character arrays are similar consepts by *very* different
C has no list, or dict
Python has no struct - float in Python is C double
